# 4-in-a-Row Game

---

## 📚 Assignment Project for Internship Application

This project was developed as part of my application process to secure an engineering internship. The goal was to design and implement a real-time, backend-driven version of the classic game 4 in a Row (Connect Four), supporting both player-vs-player and player-vs-bot gameplay, with real-time features and persistent storage.

### 📝 Assignment Brief
- **Game Objective:** Build a real-time, backend-driven version of the classic game 4 in a Row, playable between two players or a competitive bot.
- **Gameplay Requirements:** Players take turns dropping discs into a 7x6 grid, aiming to connect four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to win.
- **Technical Requirements:** Develop a multiplayer game server using Node.js or GoLang, implement player matchmaking with a competitive bot fallback, and use WebSockets for real-time gameplay.
- **Gameplay Features:** Real-time updates, 30-second reconnection window, and a leaderboard.
- **Frontend Requirements:** A basic frontend with a 7x6 grid, username input, disc dropping, real-time opponent moves, result display, and leaderboard.
- **Backend Requirements:** In-memory game state, persistent storage for completed games, and optional Kafka integration for analytics.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- MongoDB (v5+ recommended)
- Apache Kafka (optional, for analytics)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/connect4-multiplayer/4-in-a-row.git
cd 4-in-a-row
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install all dependencies (root, backend, frontend)
npm run install-all
```

### 3. Database Setup
```bash
# Start MongoDB (if not already running)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo systemctl start mongod

# On Windows:
# Start MongoDB service from Services

# The application will automatically create collections on first run
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/four_in_a_row

# Kafka Configuration (Optional)
KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=4-in-a-row-backend
KAFKA_TOPIC_GAME_EVENTS=game-events
KAFKA_TOPIC_USER_EVENTS=user-events

# Game Configuration
MATCHMAKING_TIMEOUT=10000
RECONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
BOT_MOVE_DELAY=1000
```

### 5. Start Kafka (Optional)
```bash
# Start Zookeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Start Kafka
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Create topics
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic game-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic user-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### 6. Run the Application

**Development Mode:**
```bash
# Start both backend and frontend
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run backend:dev    # Backend on http://localhost:3001
npm run frontend:dev   # Frontend on http://localhost:3000
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run frontend:build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the entire application is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services (MongoDB, Backend, Frontend, Kafka)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears database)
docker-compose down -v
```

This will start:
- **MongoDB** on port 27017
- **Backend** on port 3001
- **Frontend** on port 3000
- **Kafka** on port 29092
- **Zookeeper** (for Kafka)

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Open the Game:** Go to [https://four-in-a-row-1-we1f.onrender.com/](https://four-in-a-row-1-we1f.onrender.com/)
2. **Enter Username:** Type a unique username to join the game lobby.
3. **Matchmaking:** Wait for an opponent to join (up to 10 seconds). If no player joins, you will be matched with a competitive AI bot.
4. **Gameplay:**
   - Click on any column in the 7x6 grid to drop your disc.
   - Players take turns dropping discs.
   - The goal is to connect four of your discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.
5. **Winning:** The first player to connect four discs in a row wins. If the board fills up with no winner, the game is a draw.
6. **Reconnection:** If you disconnect, you have 30 seconds to reconnect and resume your game.
7. **Leaderboard:** View the leaderboard to see top players and your stats.

## 🤖 AI Bot Features

The competitive bot uses advanced algorithms:

- **Minimax Algorithm** with alpha-beta pruning
- **Strategic Prioritization**:
  1. Win immediately if possible
  2. Block opponent's winning moves
  3. Create strategic positions
- **Board Evaluation** considering:
  - Winning patterns
  - Blocking opportunities
  - Center column preference
  - Future move potential

## 🚀 Deployment

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Create Dockerfile for Backend:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY backend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY backend/ .
EXPOSE 3001
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

2. **Create Dockerfile for Frontend:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app
COPY frontend/package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY frontend/ .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

### Environment Variables for Production
```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
DB_HOST=your-production-db-host
KAFKA_BROKER=your-kafka-broker
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Run frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials in `.env`
   - Verify database exists

2. **Kafka Connection Failed**
   - Kafka is optional - the app will work without it
   - Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running
   - Check broker configuration

3. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - Check CORS configuration
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check firewall settings

4. **Bot Not Making Moves**
   - Check game state in database
   - Verify bot AI logic
   - Check server logs for errors
